# Macro-Tracker

Daily tracker for an individual's macro-splits (nutrition).

The reasons for this app:

1. This will by my first iOS app. Something easy to get started.

2. MyFitnessPal has a 'Quick Add' option only allowing you to add calories and not the macros (unless you are a premium member). When I can't find a certain food in the database that they provide, such as food from dining halls, I would like to add the macros and calories of what I am eating.
